# FRC-LCD-Display

:large_blue_diamond: The source code here demonstrates how to set up a 4x20 LCD panel display with the Roborio (for FRC First Robotics Competition).

-------------------
##  First the hardware:

:black_small_square: We're using a display like the one in the photo 

![photo1](https://github.com/RaiderRobotics/FRC-LCD-Display/blob/master/4x20-LCD-panel.jpg). 

:black_small_square: Note that it comes with a backplate thing mounted on it. This backplate already has all of the connections between the LCD display and the I2C protocol.

:black_small_square: The connectors on the back of the LCD display do not match the connectors on the RoboRIO. The RoboRIO has the pins in a different order. Also note that the LCD display requires 5V, not the 3.3V on the RoboRIO I2C connector. We're just using 5V from a digital IO pin.  You could also use the 5V from the Voltage Regulator Module.

## CODE

### Background information

:boom: **WPI Documentation** The [WPI documenation](http://first.wpi.edu/FRC/roborio/stable/docs/java/classedu_1_1wpi_1_1first_1_1wpilibj_1_1I2C.html) is completely useless.  The [source code](https://usfirst.collab.net/gerrit/gitweb?p=allwpilib.git;f=wpilibj/wpilibjava/src/main/java/edu/wpi/first/wpilibj/I2C.java;h=8476) is no help either.

It's easy to make an I2C object: `lcdDisplay = new I2C(I2C.Port.kOnboard, 0x27);`  The address of most LCD panels is 0x27. It's a lot harder to write to the display since the only thing that the documentation tells you is `boolean 	write (int registerAddress, int data)`. There is no explanation of what the register address should be, no examples of this being used anywhere. *(I finally figured it out, see below.)*
 
:boom: LCD Panels are all driven by the [Hitachi HD44780 driver](http://www.waveshare.com/datasheet/LCD_en_PDF/HD44780.pdf). This page provides details, explains the display addressing, and lists the commands that are build in.

:boom: There are some very useful code examples here:

* LCD panel display documentation:  http://www.microcontrollerboard.com/lcd.html
* Using Java to access I2C devices with examples of LCD display:  https://docs.oracle.com/javame/8.1/me-dev-guide/i2c.htm
* This helped understand the hardware a bit. http://letsmakerobots.com/content/drive-standard-hd44780-lcd-using-pcf8574-and-i2c
 
:boom: Finally, I realized that [my python code](https://github.com/salamander2/RaspberryPi/tree/master/programs/LCD) :snake: (which I got from someone else's Raspberry Pi repository) could be directly ported to Java.  **It worked!!!**

-----------------

### How the code works

* It turns out that the register to write the I2C data is ALWAYS 0 (I'm talking about the WPI `I2C.write()` command).  Why? This is either the I2C controller or the register on the I2C device.  So it seems that the LCD display only has one (external facing) register.
* However ... internally, there are TWO registers: a command register and a data/display register. The registers are INTERNAL and are selected by using the Rs bit or not.
* Commands are always written 4 bits at a time. Why? This is because it's the way that everyone does it. (Originally it was so that you need fewer data lines connected to your display.)
* Commands have to be "strobed" using the En bit for them to take effect.
* Commands do not execute instantaneously, so you need a short delay between them.
* There is a sequence of initialization commands that must be done to set up the display after it's been powered on before it can be used.
* Many of the other commands (cursor movement, etc.) I have not tried.
